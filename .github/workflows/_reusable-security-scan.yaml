# Reusable Security Scan Workflow
#
# This reusable workflow orchestrates multiple security scanning tools to provide
# comprehensive security analysis of the codebase. It integrates various specialized
# scanners for different security aspects.
#
# Features:
# - Multi-tool Security Analysis
#   • Bandit for Python security
#   • ClamAV for malware detection
#   • Semgrep for SAST
#   • Trivy for vulnerabilities
#
# Scanning Capabilities:
# - Code security analysis
# - Dependency vulnerability checks
# - Infrastructure as Code scanning
# - Malware detection
# - Secret detection
# - Container security
#
# Execution Modes:
# - Full repository scan
# - Changed files only
# - Configurable tool selection
# - Adjustable severity levels
#
# Performance Features:
# - Parallel tool execution
# - Scan result caching
# - Incremental scanning
# - Resource optimization
#
# Example Usage:
#   jobs:
#     security:
#       uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-security-scan.yaml
#       with:
#         tools: "bandit,semgrep,trivy"
#         scan-scope: "changed"
#         severity-level: "MEDIUM"
#
# Note: Different security tools may require specific permissions
# or configurations. Results are preserved as workflow artifacts.
